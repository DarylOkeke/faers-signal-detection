# Cardiac Endpoints Signal Detection Analysis

**Database:** FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS), 2023 (Q1â€“Q4)
**Methodology:** Disproportionality Analysis (PRR, ROR, Chi-square)
**Cohorts Analyzed:** Hydralazine, Minoxidil (Systemic), Minoxidil (Topical)

---

## 1. Objectives

This study aimed to identify and compare signals for **serious cardiac adverse events** associated with **Hydralazine** and **Minoxidil** (systemic and topical). The primary outcomes of interest were:

* **Cardiac tamponade**
* **Pericardial effusion**
* **Pericarditis**
* **Pleural effusion**

Hydralazine was included both as a drug of interest and as a comparator due to its known association with drug-induced lupus and pericardial complications.

## 2. Methodology

### Data Source

* FAERS 2023 full dataset (Q1â€“Q4).
* Only **latest case versions** included (deduplication by CASEID/CASEVERSION).
* Restricted to **U.S. cases** with complete demographic and reaction data.

### Cohort Definitions

* **Hydralazine** (all routes).
* **Minoxidil Systemic** (oral, investigational systemic use).
* **Minoxidil Topical** (dermatological use).
* Comparator group: **All other drugs** ("OTHER").

### Case Processing

* Included **primary suspect drugs** only.
* Linked reactions (MedDRA PT level).
* Focused on four pre-specified cardiac endpoints.

### Statistical Analysis

* **Proportional Reporting Ratio (PRR)** with Haldaneâ€“Anscombe correction.
* **Reporting Odds Ratio (ROR)** with Wald 95% confidence intervals.
* **Chi-square test** for statistical significance.
* **Flagging thresholds**:

  * PRR â‰¥ 2.0
  * Ï‡Â² â‰¥ 4.0
  * N â‰¥ 3 cases

### Validation

* **Positive control:** Ciprofloxacin â†’ Tendon rupture (expected signal).
* **Negative control:** Metformin â†’ Alopecia (expected no signal).
* Both controls behaved as expected, confirming methodology validity.

## 3. Results

### Executive Summary

* **Hydralazine** demonstrated the **strongest cardiac safety signals**, especially for tamponade and pericardial effusion.
* **Systemic Minoxidil** showed **moderate but significant signals**.
* **Topical Minoxidil** showed **no cardiac signals** (all N=0).

### High-Priority Findings

* Hydralazine + Cardiac Tamponade â†’ PRR = 165.8 (95% CI: 73.1â€“375.7)
* Hydralazine + Pericardial Effusion â†’ PRR = 51.0 (95% CI: 28.4â€“91.8)
* Minoxidil Systemic + Cardiac Tamponade â†’ PRR = 49.2 (95% CI: 18.2â€“133.5)
* Minoxidil Systemic + Pericardial Effusion â†’ PRR = 12.5 (95% CI: 5.6â€“27.9)

## 4. Clinical Interpretation

### Hydralazine

* **Very high signal strength** for tamponade and effusion.
* Likely mediated through **drug-induced lupus/pericarditis** mechanism.
* **Implication:** Strong evidence for causal association; monitoring essential.

### Minoxidil Systemic

* Moderate signals for tamponade and effusion.
* Likely related to **fluid retention and hemodynamic stress**.
* **Implication:** Use requires **cardiac monitoring**, especially in at-risk patients.

### Minoxidil Topical

* No cardiac adverse events reported in 2023 FAERS.
* **Implication:** Appears safe with standard monitoring.

## 5. Risk Assessment Summary

| Drug               | Risk Level   | Key Concerns                    | Clinical Recommendation                    |
| ------------------ | ------------ | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Hydralazine        | ðŸ”´ Very High | Tamponade, Pericardial effusion | Enhanced monitoring, consider alternatives |
| Minoxidil Systemic | ðŸŸ¡ Moderate  | Tamponade, Pericardial effusion | Cardiac monitoring during therapy          |
| Minoxidil Topical  | ðŸŸ¢ Low       | None detected                   | Standard care adequate                     |

## 6. Limitations

* FAERS is a **spontaneous reporting system** â†’ subject to underreporting, reporting bias, and confounding.
* Disproportionality â‰  causality â€” signals indicate associations, not proof.
* Cohort sizes vary widely; topical Minoxidil has few reports relative to systemic or Hydralazine.
* Prescription volume normalization not applied in this report (planned for future integration with Medicare data).

---

## 7. Visual Summaries

* **Bar plots:** Case counts across cohorts and endpoints.
* **Forest plots:** PRR with 95% CI, log-scaled for clarity.
* **Streamlit App:** Interactive dashboard developed for reproducibility, exploration, and visualization.

---

## 8. Conclusions

* **Hydralazine** demonstrates **clear, strong safety signals** for life-threatening cardiac complications.
* **Systemic Minoxidil** shows **moderate but concerning associations** with similar endpoints.
* **Topical Minoxidil** appears safe at the cardiac level.
* Clinical vigilance is warranted, particularly with Hydralazine.

---

## 9. Deliverables

* **Trimmed cardiac endpoint tables** (CSV + Markdown).
* **Figures:** Bar + forest plots.
* **Streamlit App (`app.py`)**: Allows dynamic exploration of FAERS signals across all cohorts and endpoints.
* **Validation tests:** Controls confirm pipeline reproducibility.
* **Full repo structure:** Scripts (`scripts/`), core modules (`src/`), tests (`tests/`), outputs (`outputs/`), and app (`app/`).
